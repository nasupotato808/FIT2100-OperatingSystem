1. Process Hierarchy:
- Every process, except for the init process (PID 1), has a parent process.
- By tracing the Parent Process ID (PPID) chain, we can map the entire process tree back to the root (PID 1).

2. Comparison of Tools:
a.  ps command:
- Provides a detailed list of processes in a text format.
- Shows key information like PID, PPID, and command names.
- Does not display threads separately from their parent processes.

b. htop command (with -t option):
- Offers a visual, tree-structured view of processes.
- Distinguishes between processes (white entries) and their threads (green entries).
- Makes parent-child relationships more immediately apparent.

3. Visibility of Processes and Threads:
- The ps command output (represented in the text file) shows mainly processes.
- htop provides a more comprehensive view, including both processes and their associated threads.
- Threads (green entries in htop) are not individually visible in the ps output.
