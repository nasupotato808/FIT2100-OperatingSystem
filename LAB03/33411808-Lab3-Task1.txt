Task1
// Refer to ptree.txt and task1.png

Try tracing the process tree for a few other processes other than bash, in the ptree.txt file
you created in Section 2.2. What can you observe?
- Every process, except for the init process (PID 1), has a parent process.
- By tracing the Parent Process ID (PPID) chain, we can map the entire process tree back to the root (PID 1).


Is the result of running htop in agreement with your results from manually tracing the process
tree earlier?
Yes.

Brief summary of findings.
1. Comparison of Tools:
a.  ps command:
- Provides a detailed list of processes in a text format.
- Shows key information like PID, PPID, and command names.
- Does not display threads separately from their parent processes.

b. htop command (with -t option):
- Offers a visual, tree-structured view of processes.
- Distinguishes between processes (white entries) and their threads (green entries).
- Makes parent-child relationships more immediately apparent.

2. Visibility of Processes and Threads:
- The ps command output (represented in the text file) shows mainly processes.
- htop provides a more comprehensive view, including both processes and their associated threads.
- Threads (green entries in htop) are not individually visible in the ps output.
