/* Lab 4 Task 2*/
1. The processes are unlikely to complete in the exact order they were initiated. This is due to the nature of operating system schedulling and the concurrent execution of child processes.

Enter the number of child processes to create: Child process with PID: 36884 and Parent PID: 36608 is starting
Child process with PID: 36884 has finished

2. Reason for Non-Sequential Completion:
- OS scheduling: The operating system's scheduler determines the process.
    - Sleep:
        - simulates some form of work or processing time for each child process
        - the process is in a blocked state
        - not consume CPU time, allowing other process to run
        - but it still occupies memory and other system resources allocated to it.


7. Potential Variations:
   - On a heavily loaded system, you might observe more randomness in the completion order.
   - On a lightly loaded system with many cores, the completion order might more closely match the creation order, especially with fewer processes.

Code:
if pid < 0, exit with a false value
In the first for loop, the parent forks multiple child according to user input.
In child process, print the child process PID and parent process PID
sleep(3): delay for a specific amount of time -- 3 seconds
print the child process id has finished.
exit(0): exit with a true value

second first loop:
wait(NULL) function call is used in the parent process to wait for child process to terminated.
- causes the parent process to block until one of its child processes terminates
- it is used to ensure that the parent doesn't terminate before all its children have finished executing
pid wait(int *status)
called with NULL, discard informaiton about the child's termination status

1. **Process Completion Order:**
   The processes are unlikely to complete in the exact order they were initiated. This is due to the nature of operating system scheduling and the concurrent execution of child processes.

2. **Reasons for Non-Sequential Completion:**
   - **OS Scheduling:** 
3. **Consistency Across Runs:**
   - You may notice that the order of process completion is not consistent across different runs, even with the same number of child processes.
   - Process IDs (PIDs) will likely be different in each run, as they are assigned by the operating system based on availability.

4. **Behavior with Different Numbers of Processes:**
   - With 4 processes, you might see more consistent behavior if you have a quad-core CPU, as each process could potentially run on its own core.
   - With 10 processes, especially on a system with fewer than 10 cores, you're more likely to see varied completion orders due to time-sharing between processes.

5. **Parent Process Behavior:**
   - The parent process creates all child processes in quick succession and then waits for all of them to complete.
   - You'll notice that the "All children have terminated" message appears only after all child processes have finished.

6. **Process ID Patterns:**
   - Child process PIDs are typically sequential or close to sequential, as they're created one after another.
   - However, the exact PIDs can vary between runs and depend on system activity.

7. **Potential Variations:**
   - On a heavily loaded system, you might observe more randomness in the completion order.
   - On a lightly loaded system with many cores, the completion order might more closely match the creation order, especially with fewer processes.

This behavior demonstrates key concepts in operating systems such as process scheduling, concurrency, and the non-deterministic nature of multi-process execution in a time-sharing environment.
